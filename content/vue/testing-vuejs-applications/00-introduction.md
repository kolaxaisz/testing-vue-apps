# Abandon and Cultivate    

Happiness depends on properly cultivating what is wholesome and discarding what is  unwholesome.    —Sonam Rinchen    Here’s a simple yet foundational teaching from the Buddha:    Abandon what is unskillful. One can abandon the unskillful. If it were not pos-  sible, I would not ask you to do so. If this abandoning of the unskillful would  bring harm and suffering, I would not ask you to abandon it. But as the aban-  doning of the unskillful brings benefit and happiness, therefore, I say, “Aban-  don what is unskillful!”    Having read that, pause to ask yourself: “What’s not working well in my life?  What area is unskillful and no longer serves me well?” This could be anything from  a job, a career, a relationship, an addiction, etc. Once identified, do what the Bud-  dha advises: “Abandon what is unskillful” in order to experience more benefit and  happiness.  There’s a second part to the Buddha’s teaching:    Cultivate that which is skillful. One can cultivate the skillful. If it were not pos-  sible, I would not ask you to do it. If this cultivation of the skillful would bring  harm and suffering, I would not ask you to cultivate it. But as the cultivation of  the skillful brings benefit and happiness, therefore, I say, “Cultivate that which  is skillful!”    Now, having read this second part of his teaching, pause to ask yourself: “What 
brings me a great deal of satisfaction, pleasure, joy and happiness in life?” Once  identified, then do more of that, because these activities or attitudes bring you  more benefit and happiness.  It is really just that simple!
